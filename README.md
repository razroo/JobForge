## What Is This

JobForge turns Claude Code into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a unified 10-dimension weighted scoring system
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs with anti-AI-detection writing rules
- **Scans portals** with fuzzy dedup (catches reposts with new URLs)
- **Processes in batch** -- evaluate 10+ offers in parallel with sub-agents
- **Tracks everything** with pipeline integrity checks and canonical state management
- **Manages follow-ups** -- timing-based nudges so you never miss a window
- **Learns from rejections** -- pattern analysis across all rejections by stage, archetype, and score
- **Negotiates offers** -- structured comp breakdown, leverage assessment, counter-offer strategy

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** The whole point is to apply only where there's a real match. The scoring system helps you focus on high-fit opportunities instead of wasting everyone's time. Always review before submitting.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/CharlieGreenman/JobForge.git
cd JobForge && npm install
claude mcp add geometra -- npx -y @geometra/mcp   # Browser automation + PDF generation

# 2. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies

# 3. Add your CV
# Create cv.md in the project root with your CV in markdown

# 4. Personalize with Claude
claude   # Open Claude Code in this directory

# Then ask Claude to adapt the system to you:
# "Change the archetypes to backend engineering roles"
# "Add these 5 companies to portals.yml"
# "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting"

# 5. Start using
# Paste a job URL or run /job-forge
```

> **The system is designed to be customized by Claude itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask Claude to change them.
