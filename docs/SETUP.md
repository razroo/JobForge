# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed and configured
- Node.js 18+ (for PDF generation and utility scripts)
- (Optional) Go 1.21+ (for the dashboard TUI)

## Quick Start (5 steps)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharlieGreenman/JobForge.git
cd JobForge
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # Required for PDF generation
```

### 2. Configure your profile

```bash
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml
```

Edit `config/profile.yml` with your personal details: name, email, target roles, narrative, proof points.

### 3. Add your CV

Create `cv.md` in the project root with your full CV in markdown format. This is the source of truth for all evaluations and PDFs.

(Optional) Create `article-digest.md` with proof points from your portfolio projects/articles.

### 4. Configure portals

```bash
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml
```

Edit `portals.yml`:
- Update `title_filter.positive` with keywords matching your target roles
- Add companies you want to track in `tracked_companies`
- Customize `search_queries` for your preferred job boards

### 5. Start using

Open Claude Code in this directory:

```bash
claude
```

Then paste a job offer URL or description. JobForge will automatically evaluate it, generate a report, create a tailored PDF, and track it.

## Available Commands

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Evaluate an offer | Paste a URL or JD text |
| Search for offers | `/job-forge scan` |
| Process pending URLs | `/job-forge pipeline` |
| Generate a PDF | `/job-forge pdf` |
| Batch evaluate | `/job-forge batch` |
| Check tracker status | `/job-forge tracker` |
| Fill application form | `/job-forge apply` |

## Verify Setup

```bash
npm run verify               # Pipeline integrity (same as verify-pipeline.mjs; OK if tracker not created yet)
node cv-sync-check.mjs       # Configuration check (requires cv.md and config/profile.yml)
```

## Build Dashboard (Optional)

```bash
cd dashboard
go build -o job-forge-dashboard .
./job-forge-dashboard            # Opens TUI pipeline viewer
```
