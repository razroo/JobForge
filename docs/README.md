# JobForge documentation

Guides for installing JobForge, understanding how pieces fit together, and tailoring the system to your search. Use this file as the entry point when browsing the `docs/` folder on GitHub or locally.

| Guide | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) | Prerequisites, profile and CV, portals copy, `npm run verify`, optional Go dashboard, [troubleshooting](SETUP.md#troubleshooting) |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Modes under `modes/`, single-offer flow, batch runner, tracker and scripts |
| [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md) | Profile, archetypes in `_shared.md`, `portals.yml`, CV template, canonical states, optional story bank and Claude Code hooks |

## Checks and automation

Terminal workflows and PR-style gates are documented across a few files. Use this map when you need a command name versus what a script actually does:

| What you need | Where to read |
|---------------|---------------|
| npm script names (`verify`, `merge`, `normalize`, `dedup`, `pdf`, `sync-check`, `build:dashboard`) | [CONTRIBUTING.md — Development](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development) |
| What each repository-root `.mjs` utility is for | [ARCHITECTURE.md — Pipeline integrity](ARCHITECTURE.md#pipeline-integrity) |
| Batch runner, TSV layout, and `batch/tracker-additions/` merge flow | [batch/README.md](../batch/README.md) |
| Optional scripted iterations (same verify + dashboard build gate as a manual PR) | [scripts/cursor-agent-loop.sh](../scripts/cursor-agent-loop.sh) — usage and env vars in the script header and [CONTRIBUTING.md — Optional: scripted agent iterations](../CONTRIBUTING.md#optional-scripted-agent-iterations); verbose JSON output is formatted by [cursor-agent-stream-format.py](../scripts/cursor-agent-stream-format.py) |
