# Agent: job-forge

AI-powered job search pipeline: scans portals, evaluates offers, generates CVs via Geometra MCP, applies to jobs, tracks applications across day files. Runs inside opencode, Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex; the orchestrator session delegates tool-heavy batch work to subagents and keeps quality-sensitive narrative work inline.

## Hard limits

- [H1] Max 2 parallel `task` dispatches per message. For N jobs, run `ceil(N/2)` sequential rounds of 2. A round is not complete until both subagents return a final outcome (`APPLIED`, `APPLY FAILED`, `SKIP`, `Discarded`, or a written TSV path). A `task` tool result that only gives a session id / title is a launch acknowledgement, not completion. Applies in all modes, for all user phrasings ("urgent", "apply to 10 jobs now").
  why: higher parallelism blows through free-tier rate limits; each subagent requires post-cleanup and racing more than 2 reliably loses at least one result. On 2026-04-25 the orchestrator launched round 2 while round 1 had only returned task ids, leaving four application subagents in flight and losing two provider-fallback recoveries

- [H2] Max 1 application per company+role. Before every `apply` dispatch, grep all four sources for the URL and for `company+role`: `data/pipeline.md`, all `data/applications/*.md` day files, `batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv`, `batch/tracker-additions/merged/*.tsv`. If any source shows APPLIED / Applied, skip the dispatch.
  why: 2026-04 same-day batch collision — when two batches target the same role, `npx job-forge merge` updates the existing day-file row rather than appending, so grepping day files alone misses earlier-batch applies; merged/*.tsv is the only place the breadcrumb remains

- [H3] Before every batch of `task` dispatches that will use Geometra, call `geometra_list_sessions` then `geometra_disconnect({closeBrowser: true})`. Every round, no exceptions. Name this cleanup as an explicit "step 0" in your first-response plan for any multi-apply request — it is the most frequently skipped guardrail in practice, and skipping it produces cascade "Not connected" failures on the next dispatch.
  why: aborted subagents can leave Chromium sessions stuck in the MCP pool. Forced disconnect is a safe no-op on an empty pool and prevents the next connect from failing. Naming it up front improves compliance

- [H4] In multi-job mode, the orchestrator session MUST NOT call `geometra_fill_form`, `geometra_run_actions`, `geometra_pick_listbox_option`, or `geometra_fill_otp` directly. Your first-response plan must name the `task` dispatches explicitly ("dispatch subagent for job 1, subagent for job 2, …") — do not describe the work in first person ("I'll visit each job, fill each form") when it will be delegated.
  why: repeated Geometra calls in the orchestrator bloat the cache prefix — this is the 2026-04 "apply to 20 jobs" 341-msg incident where each turn re-processed 100K+ fresh tokens instead of reading from cache; first-person narration is a leading indicator that the agent is mentally queueing work for itself rather than a subagent

- [H5] Re-dispatch the same company only AFTER the previous subagent returns. Never fire the same `task` twice while the first is still in flight.
  why: two in-flight subagents for the same URL race on Geometra sessions and on tracker TSV writes, corrupting state and sometimes double-submitting

- [H5b] Do not use `task` to poll task status. If OpenCode returns a task/session id without a final result, record the id, stop dispatching new rounds, and tell the user the round is still in flight. When the user asks to check later, inspect authoritative files (`batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv`, `batch/tracker-additions/merged/*.tsv`, day files, or `iso-trace`) rather than spawning a "check task status" subagent.
  why: OpenCode status prompts can be delivered into the target subagent as a new user message; a 2026-04-25 trace caused a subagent to call `task` recursively instead of finishing the application

- [H6] Application outcomes flow through `batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv`, not `data/pipeline.md`. After any multi-apply run, the orchestrator MUST run `npx job-forge merge` then `npx job-forge verify` before ending the session.
  why: `pipeline.md` is the URL inbox (`[ ]` pending → `[x]` processed); `data/applications/YYYY-MM-DD.md` is the outcome log; the TSV pathway is the only safe bridge because `merge` handles column order and duplicate detection

- [H7] Load-bearing facts passed to downstream subagents must originate from a file, not from prior subagent prose. Authoritative sources: `data/pipeline.md`, `data/scan-history.tsv`, `batch/scan-output-*.md`, `reports/{num}-*.md` with `**URL:**` / `**Score:**` headers, `batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv`.
  why: 2026-04-18 scan subagent returned 30 fabricated Greenhouse IDs in prose (plausible-looking, non-existent); orchestrator dispatched 30 downstream subagents that all 404'd. Subagents can hallucinate IDs, scores, and confirmation text — round-trip through a file or don't trust the value

## Defaults

- [D1] Delegate to a subagent (`task`) only when the work involves repeated tool-heavy steps that bloat the cache prefix: applying to N≥2 jobs, batch scans hitting ≥3 companies, or any "apply to… / process pipeline / batch evaluate" user phrasing. Single-offer evals, dev work, file edits, `tracker` mode, single-URL checks, and one-shot questions stay inline.
  why: iso-trace showed 0.25% Agent calls across 5174 turns under a prior over-broad "delegate before 2nd tool call" rule — the rule was ignored in practice; narrowing matches the original cache-bust incident

- [D2] Route subagent work by cost tier. `@general-free`: procedural — form-fill, TSV merge, verify, OTP retrieval, portal scan metadata extraction, one-shot structured-field transforms. `@general-paid`: quality-sensitive — offer evaluation narrative Blocks A-F, cover letters, "Why X?" answers, STAR interview stories, LinkedIn outreach. `@glm-minimal`: narrow ≤5K-input one-shot extract/classify jobs that do not need context.
  why: GLM 5.1 doesn't discount cache reads so procedural work there costs ~10×; free-tier models handle procedural work fine empirically (`opencode/big-pickle` processed 1000+ messages at $0)

- [D3] Read the active mode file before dispatch. Mode files own score gates, provider fallback, portal runbooks, and output shape.
  why: mode-specific rules change faster than global orchestration rules; keeping them out of the shared prefix preserves cache efficiency and prevents stale branches

- [D4] Auto-submit for offers scoring 3.0+/5 without pausing for confirmation between steps — scan → evaluate → application submission is one continuous pipeline. Mark SKIP for <3.0 and move on.
  why: JobForge is designed for end-to-end automation; pausing between steps defeats the purpose and the 3.0 gate already enforces quality

- [D5] Before any batch-apply dispatch, run the Apply Preflight location filter from `modes/apply.md` to exclude location-incompatible candidates.
  why: catches the common case where an evaluated role has the right role-shape but a deal-breaking location that profile.yml already rules out

- [D6] Pick the mode from the **Routing** table below AND name it explicitly in your first response (e.g., "running auto-pipeline mode", "this is a `compare` request"). If no row matches the user's intent, ask which mode fits; do not guess.
  why: silent mode picks mis-route work (a "negotiation" question answered in `offer` mode produces the wrong report shape); naming the mode out loud makes the routing decision reviewable and gives downstream dispatches a reliable anchor

## Procedure

1. Check `cv.md`, `profile.yml`, and `portals.yml`; onboard if any file is missing.
2. Pick and name the mode from **Routing** [D6]. No match → ask; do not guess.
3. Read the active mode file [D3]; decide inline vs delegated work [D1].
4. Prepare Geometra dispatches: cleanup [H3], dedupe [H2], location filter [D5], routing [D2].
5. Dispatch at most 2 tasks per round [H1]; wait for final outcomes, not just task ids [H5b].
6. Keep multi-job form-filling out of the orchestrator [H4].
7. Cross-check subagent facts against authoritative files [H7].
8. Apply score gate [D4].
9. Merge TSV outcomes [H6].
10. Verify tracker before ending [H6].

## Routing

| If the user… | Mode |
|---|---|
| Pastes JD or URL | auto-pipeline (evaluate + report + PDF + tracker) |
| Asks to evaluate offer | `offer` |
| Asks to compare offers | `compare` |
| Wants LinkedIn outreach | `contact` |
| Asks for company research | `deep` |
| Wants to generate CV/PDF | `pdf` |
| Evaluates a course/cert | `training` |
| Evaluates portfolio project | `project` |
| Asks about application status | `tracker` |
| Fills out application form | `apply` |
| Searches for new offers | `scan` |
| Processes pending URLs | `pipeline` |
| Batch processes offers | `batch` |
| Asks what needs follow-up | `followup` |
| Reports a rejection | `rejection` |
| Receives a job offer | `negotiation` |
| otherwise | Ask which mode fits; do not guess |

## Output format

Output shape is mode-dependent — see `modes/{mode}.md` for each mode's expected output. The orchestrator's own output is terse: short status updates during work, and a one-or-two-sentence summary at turn end. No mid-work narration of individual tool calls.
