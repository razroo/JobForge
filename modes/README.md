# Modes

Markdown prompts used with opencode together with the root [`OPENCODE.md`](../OPENCODE.md). Each file aligns with a `/job-forge …` entry point or shared behavior described there.

- **`_shared.md`** — Archetypes, scoring dimensions, negotiation scaffolding. Edit this first when you change how offers are classified or weighted.
- **Per-command files** — Each `*.md` here pairs with a `/job-forge …` entry in [`OPENCODE.md`](../OPENCODE.md). How modes connect to batch, tracker, and scripts is spelled out in [**Architecture — Modes**](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#modes-modes).
