# Mode: pipeline — URL Inbox (Second Brain)

Processes accumulated job offer URLs from `data/pipeline.md`. The user adds URLs at any time and then runs `/job-forge pipeline` to process them all.

## Run This Workflow

1. **Read** `data/pipeline.md` → find `- [ ]` items in the "Pending" section
2. **For each pending URL**:
   a. Calculate the next sequential `REPORT_NUM` by running `npx job-forge next-num` (scans `reports/`, day file `#` columns, and `batch/tracker-additions/` — do NOT derive from `reports/` alone)
   b. **Extract JD** using Geometra MCP (geometra_connect + geometra_page_model) → WebFetch → WebSearch
   c. If the URL is not accessible → mark as `- [!]` with a note and continue
   d. **Run full auto-pipeline**: A-F Evaluation → Report .md → PDF (if score >= 3.0, per `_shared.md` thresholds) → Draft answers (if score >= 3.5) → Tracker
   e. **Move from "Pending" to "Processed"**: `- [x] #NNN | URL | Company | Role | Score/5 | PDF ✅/❌`
3. **Parallel dispatch — max 2 at a time** (Hard Limit #1 in `AGENTS.md`). For N pending URLs, run `ceil(N/2)` rounds of 2 `task` dispatches. Never 3+ in one message.
4. **When finished**, display a summary table:

```
| # | Company | Role | Score | PDF | Recommended action |
```

## Apply pipeline.md Format

```markdown
## Pending
- [ ] https://jobs.example.com/posting/123
- [ ] https://boards.greenhouse.io/company/jobs/456 | Company Inc | Senior PM
- [!] https://private.url/job — Error: login required

## Processed
- [x] #143 | https://jobs.example.com/posting/789 | Acme Corp | AI PM | 4.2/5 | PDF ✅
- [x] #144 | https://boards.greenhouse.io/xyz/jobs/012 | BigCo | SA | 2.1/5 | PDF ❌
```

## Detect JD From URL

1. **Greenhouse JSON API (FIRST, when the entry has `| gh={slug}/{id}` OR the host looks Greenhouse-backed):** WebFetch `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{slug}/jobs/{id}`. 200 + JSON with `content` = LIVE, use it as the JD; 404 = genuinely CLOSED (mark `- [!]` and continue). Bot-hostile customer fronts (`pinterestcareers.com`, `okta.com`, `samsara.com`, `zoominfo.com`, `collibra.com`, `careers.toasttab.com`, `careers.airbnb.com`, `coinbase.com`, `instacart.careers`, `careers.toasttab.com`) MUST be verified via this API first — WebFetch/Geometra of those domains returns a shell or 403 and causes false CLOSED marks.
2. **Geometra MCP:** `geometra_connect` + `geometra_page_model`. Works with non-Greenhouse SPAs (Lever, Ashby, Workday), uses fewer tokens than raw DOM snapshots.
3. **WebFetch (fallback):** For static pages or when Geometra is not available.
4. **WebSearch (last resort):** Search on secondary portals that index the JD.

**Special cases:**
- **LinkedIn**: May require login → mark `[!]` and ask the user to paste the text
- **PDF**: If the URL points to a PDF, read it directly with the Read tool
- **`local:` prefix**: Read the local file. Example: `local:jds/linkedin-pm-ai.md` → read `jds/linkedin-pm-ai.md`

## Automatic Numbering

Run `npx job-forge next-num` — returns the next 3-digit zero-padded report number. The CLI scans:

1. `reports/*.md` filename prefixes
2. The `#` column of every `data/applications/*.md` day file
3. The `{num}` prefix of every `batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv` (pending + merged)

Takes the max across all three sources and adds 1. Do NOT derive from any single source — prior-day SKIPs and other non-report tracker entries advance the counter but never write to `reports/`, so `ls reports/` alone misses them.

## Source Synchronization

Before processing any URL, verify sync:
```bash
npx job-forge sync-check
```
If there is a desynchronization, warn the user before continuing.

## Run This Pipeline Runbook When N >= 2

```
Step 1  — Read data/pipeline.md; collect "- [ ]" URLs into `pending = [url_1, ..., url_N]`
Step 2  — Pre-flight cleanup (once, before loop):
            geometra_list_sessions()
            geometra_disconnect({ closeBrowser: true })
Step 3  — For round in ceil(N/2):
            pair = pending[round*2 : round*2 + 2]
            # ONE message, 1 or 2 task() calls. Never 3.
            task(process url pair[0])
            task(process url pair[1])  # only if pair has 2
            # WAIT for both returns before the next round.
Step 4  — Between rounds: geometra_list_sessions() + geometra_disconnect({closeBrowser: true})
Step 5  — Reconcile outcomes (Hard Limit #6):
            bash: npx job-forge merge      # TSVs → correct day file
            bash: npx job-forge verify     # validate URL/status consistency
Step 6  — Display summary table; flag any verify-pipeline errors.
```

**Hard rules:**
- Max 2 `task` dispatches per message (Hard Limit #1).
- Never re-dispatch a URL whose previous subagent is still in-flight (Hard Limit #5).
- Orchestrator does not call `geometra_fill_form` / `geometra_page_model` in multi-URL runs (Hard Limit #4) — delegate.
- **The only edits allowed to `data/pipeline.md` are flipping `[ ]` → `[x]`** (inbox state) (Hard Limit #6). APPLIED / FAILED / SKIP outcomes go via `batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv` into the day file. Do NOT write application status to pipeline.md.
