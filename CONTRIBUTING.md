# Contributing to JobForge

Thanks for your interest in contributing! JobForge is built with Claude Code, and you can use it for development too.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test with a fresh clone (see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md))
5. Commit and push
6. Open a Pull Request

## What to Contribute

**Good first contributions:**
- Add companies to `templates/portals.example.yml`
- Improve documentation
- Add example CVs for different roles (in `examples/` — see `examples/README.md`)
- Report bugs via [Issues](https://github.com/CharlieGreenman/JobForge/issues)

**Bigger contributions:**
- New evaluation dimensions or scoring logic
- Dashboard TUI features (in `dashboard/`)
- New skill modes (in `modes/`)
- Script improvements (`.mjs` utilities)

## Guidelines

- Scripts should handle missing files gracefully (check `existsSync` before `readFileSync`)
- Dashboard changes require `go build` — test with real data before submitting
- Don't commit personal data (cv.md, profile.yml, applications.md, reports/)

## Development

Before opening a PR, from the repo root:

```bash
npm run verify
npm run build:dashboard
```

(`npm run build:dashboard` is the same as `(cd dashboard && go build .)` — requires Go on PATH.)

`npm run verify` runs `verify-pipeline.mjs`. It exits successfully when `data/applications.md` is missing (fresh clone).

Other npm scripts:

| Script | Runs | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|
| `npm run build:dashboard` | `go build` in `dashboard/` | Optional TUI; same check as manual `cd dashboard && go build .` |
| `npm run sync-check` | `cv-sync-check.mjs` | Optional setup lint: `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, hardcoded-metric scan; fails if those files are missing |
| `npm run normalize` | `normalize-statuses.mjs` | Maps non-canonical statuses in `data/applications.md`; no-op if the tracker file is missing |
| `npm run dedup` | `dedup-tracker.mjs` | Merges duplicate company/role rows; no-op if the tracker file is missing |
| `npm run merge` | `merge-tracker.mjs` | Merges `batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv` into the tracker; no-op if the directory is missing or has no `.tsv` files; if TSVs exist but no tracker file yet, creates `data/applications.md` with an empty table (simulated only with `--dry-run`) |
| `npm run pdf` | `generate-pdf.mjs` | Pass HTML and PDF paths after `--`, e.g. `npm run pdf -- output/cv.html output/cv.pdf` |

You can run the same `.mjs` files with `node <script>.mjs` from the repo root if you prefer.

Dashboard (optional TUI). The `-path` flag must be the JobForge repo root (where `data/applications.md` or `applications.md` lives), not the `dashboard/` folder:

```bash
cd dashboard && go build -o job-forge-dashboard .
./job-forge-dashboard -path ..
```

### Optional: scripted agent iterations

For repeated non-interactive passes that follow the same checks above (explore → small change → `npm run verify` → `cd dashboard && go build .` → commit), see [`scripts/cursor-agent-loop.sh`](scripts/cursor-agent-loop.sh). It expects the Cursor Agent CLI (`agent` on PATH; see [cursor.com/install](https://cursor.com/install)). Environment variables and usage are documented in the script header — same quality gate as a manual PR, without replacing human review of diffs.

To scan for in-repo markers before picking a task (repo root; `.` includes utility scripts at the root and respects `.gitignore`):

```bash
rg 'TODO|FIXME|HACK' . --glob '*.mjs' --glob '*.go' --glob '*.md'
```
