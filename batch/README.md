# Batch evaluation

The `batch/` folder holds the **parallel batch runner** for processing 10+ job URLs with headless `opencode run` workers. For how batch fits into the rest of JobForge, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## What ships in git

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `batch-runner.sh` | Compatibility entrypoint; delegates to the durable Node orchestrator by default |
| `batch-prompt.md` | Prompt template passed to each worker (keep evaluation and scoring instructions aligned with the canonical model in [`modes/_shared.md`](../modes/_shared.md) so batch scores match single-offer runs) |
| `README.md` | This file |

## Local-only files (gitignored when present)

Per [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore): `batch-input.tsv`, `batch-state.tsv`, `logs/*`, `tracker-additions/*.tsv`, and `.jobforge-runs/`. Empty dirs (`logs/`, `tracker-additions/`) use `.gitkeep` so the tree exists in a fresh clone.

The default runner uses `@razroo/iso-orchestrator` through
`scripts/batch-orchestrator.mjs`. It persists bundle steps and events in
`.jobforge-runs/`, caps worker fan-out with `workflow.forEach`, and serializes
state/report-number writes while parallel bundles run. Use
`JOBFORGE_LEGACY_BATCH_RUNNER=1 ./batch/batch-runner.sh` only to fall back to
the old shell loop.

## Input: `batch-input.tsv`

Tab-separated UTF-8 text, with a **header row** (the runner skips the literal `id` header):

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Numeric offer id (used for state and ordering) |
| `url` | Yes | Job posting URL |
| `source` | No | Short label (e.g. board or company) |
| `notes` | No | Free text for your own context |

Example:

```text
id	url	source	notes
1	https://jobs.example.com/123	greenhouse	Staff engineer
2	https://boards.example.com/456	ashby	Remote OK
```

Create this file in **`batch/`** next to the runner (see `batch-runner.sh` constants). Then:

```bash
./batch/batch-runner.sh --dry-run   # from repo root
./batch/batch-runner.sh
```

Options and file layout: `./batch/batch-runner.sh --help`.

## After a batch run

Workers write one-line TSV rows under `batch/tracker-additions/`. Merge them into your tracker from the repo root:

```bash
npm run merge
npm run verify   # optional: pipeline health after merge (report links, statuses, pending TSVs)
```

(`npx job-forge merge` — same as `npm run merge`; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development).)

After a successful merge, each processed file is moved to **`batch/tracker-additions/merged/`** (created on first merge when the directory does not yet exist). `npm run verify` only looks for `*.tsv` files in the **top level** of `batch/tracker-additions/`, so rows already merged and archived under `merged/` do not trigger the “pending TSVs” warning.

## Prerequisites

The runner expects the `opencode` CLI on `PATH` and a valid `batch-prompt.md`. It creates `reports/` and tracker paths when they do not exist; ensure your usual JobForge setup (`cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `portals.yml`) matches what `batch-prompt.md` assumes.
